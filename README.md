## **How To Run in a Virtual Environment**

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies without affecting your global Python installation.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Packages in the Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment When Done**

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
